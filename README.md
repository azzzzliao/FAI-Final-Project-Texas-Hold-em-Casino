# FAI-Final-Project-Texas-Hold-em-Casino
This project is the final project for the **Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence** course. The goal is to develop an intelligent agent that can play **Texas Hold'em Poker** using different AI techniques.

## Methods
We implemented two approaches to develop the poker agent:

1. **Rule-Based Approach**:  
   - Used **if-else statements** to determine actions based on predefined rules.  
   - Divided the decision process into **preflop** and **postflop** stages.  
   - Applied **hand strength evaluation** and **player position** to make decisions.  

2. **Reinforcement Learning Approach (Q-Learning)**:  
   - Trained an agent using **Q-learning**, a reinforcement learning technique.  
   - Incorporated **opponent behavior** and **game state features** to improve decision-making.  
   - Used existing resources such as **random players** and a GitHub repository from classmates to assist development.
